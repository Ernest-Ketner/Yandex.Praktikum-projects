# Machine Learning model for a metalworking enterprise

### Task:
Development of a model predicting the recovery rate of gold from gold ore.

### Description:
The company develops solutions for the efficient operation of the gold mining industry. A model has been built that predicts the recovery rate of gold from gold-bearing ore. The data with the parameters of extraction and treatment are analyzed. A model has been built and trained to help optimize production in order not to launch an enterprise with unprofitable characteristics.
